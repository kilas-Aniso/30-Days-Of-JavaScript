const age =prompt("Enter your age:");

if (age >= 18) {

} else {
  const yearsLeft = 18 - age;
  console.log(`You are left with ${yearsLeft} year(s) to drive.`);

/*
1. Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if ‚Ä¶ else. 
Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who

const myAge = 20;
const yourAge = prompt('Enter your age: ');

if (myAge === yourAge.value) {
  prompt('We are agemates');
} else if (myAge < yourAge.value)  {
  console.log(`You are older than me by ${yourAge - myAge} years`);
} else {
  console.log(`You are younger than me by ${myAge - yourAge} years`);
}

// 1. If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less 
// than b'. Try to implement it in to ways

//     - ternary operator.

//     ```js
//       let a = 4
//       let b = 3

//     ```sh
//       4 is greater than 3
//     ```

let a = 20
let b = 10

if (a>b){
    console.log( `${a} is greater than ${b}`)
}
else{
  console.log( `${b} is greater than ${a}`)
}
let result = (a < b) ?'a is greater than b' :'b is greater than a'
   
  console.log(result)
